# Custom tree handler

What to do if a time comes, and you need some fancy stuff done to tree items that
**django-sitetree** does not support?

It might be that you need some special tree items ordering in a menu, or you want to render
a huge site tree with all articles titles that are described by one tree item in Django admin,
or god knows what else.

**django-sitetree** can facilitate on that as it allows tree handler customization
with the help of `SITETREE_CLS` setting.

1. Subclass `sitetreeapp.SiteTree` and place that class into a separate module for convenience.
2. You may now override **.apply_hook()** to manipulate tree items before render, or any other method to customize handler to your exact needs.
3. Define `SITETREE_CLS` in `settings.py` of your project, showing it a dotted path to the subclass.


Example:

```python title="myapp/mysitetree.py"
from sitetree.sitetreeapp import SiteTree


class MySiteTree(SiteTree):
    """Custom tree handler to test deep customization abilities."""

    def apply_hook(self, tree_items, sender):
        # Suppose we want to process only menu child items.
        if sender == 'menu.children':
            # Let's add 'Hooked: ' to resolved titles of every item.
            for item in tree_items:
                item.title_resolved = 'Hooked: %s' % item.title_resolved
        # Return items list mutated or not.
        return tree_items
```

```python title="myproject/settings.py"
...
SITETREE_CLS = 'myapp.mysitetree.MySiteTree'
...
```
