# Internationalization

With `django-sitetree` it is possible to render different trees for different active
locales still addressing them by the same alias from a template.

**register_i18n_trees()** function registers aliases of internationalized sitetrees.
Internationalized sitetrees are those, which are dubbed by other trees having
locale identifying suffixes in their aliases.

Let's suppose `my_tree` is the alias of a generic tree. This tree is the one
that we call by its alias in templates, and it is the one which is used
if no i18n version of that tree is found.

Given that `my_tree_en`, `my_tree_ru` and other `my_tree_{locale-id}`-like
trees are considered internationalization sitetrees. These are used (if available)
in accordance with current locale used in project.

Example:

```python
# This code usually belongs to urls.py (or `ready` method of a user defined
# sitetree application config if Django 1.7+).

# First import the register function.
from sitetree.toolbox import register_i18n_trees


# Now register i18n trees.
register_i18n_trees(['my_tree', 'my_another_tree'])

```
After that you need to create trees for languages supported
in your project, e.g.: `my_tree_en`, `my_tree_ru`, `my_tree_pt-br`.

Then when we address `my_tree` from a template django-sitetree will render
an appropriate tree for locale currently active in your project.
