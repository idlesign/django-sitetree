# Custom Admin

SiteTree allows you to override tree and tree item representation in Django Admin interface.

That could be used not only for the purpose of enhancement of visual design but also
for integration with other applications, using admin inlines.

## Overriding pages

The following functions from `sitetree.admin` could be used to override tree and tree item representation:

* **override_tree_admin()** is used to customize tree representation.
* **override_item_admin()** is used to customize tree item representation.

```python title="admin.py"
# Import two helper functions and two admin models to inherit our custom model from.
from sitetree.admin import TreeItemAdmin, TreeAdmin, override_tree_admin, override_item_admin

# This is our custom tree admin model.
class CustomTreeAdmin(TreeAdmin):
    exclude = ('title',)  # Here we exclude `title` field from form.

# And our custom tree item admin model.
class CustomTreeItemAdmin(TreeItemAdmin):
    # That will turn a tree item representation from the default variant
    # with collapsible groupings into a flat one.
    fieldsets= None

# Now we tell the SiteTree to replace generic representations with custom.
override_tree_admin(CustomTreeAdmin)
override_item_admin(CustomTreeItemAdmin)
```

## Override inlines

In the example below we'll use django-seo application from <https://github.com/willhardy/django-seo>

According to `django-seo` documentation it allows an addition of custom metadata fields to your models,
so we use it to connect metadata to sitetree items.

That's how one might render django-seo inline form on sitetree item create and edit pages:

```python
from rollyourown.seo.admin import get_inline
from sitetree.admin import TreeItemAdmin, override_item_admin
# Let's suppose our application contains seo.py with django-seo metadata class defined.
from myapp.seo import CustomMeta


class CustomTreeItemAdmin(TreeItemAdmin):
    inlines = [get_inline(CustomMeta)]

override_item_admin(CustomTreeItemAdmin)
```
