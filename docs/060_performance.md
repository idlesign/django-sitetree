# Performance notes

To avoid performance hits on large sitetrees try to simplify them, and/or reduce number of sitetree items:

* Restructure (unify) sitetree items where appropriate. E.g.:
    ```
    Home
    |-- Category "Photo"
    |   |-- Item "{{ item.title  }}"
    |
    |-- Category "Audio"
    |   |-- Item "{{ item.title  }}"
    |
    |-- etc.
    ```
    
    could be restructured into:
    ```
    Home
    |-- Category "{{ category.title }}"
    |   |-- Item "{{ item.title  }}"
    |
    |-- etc.
    ```

* Do not use `URL as Pattern` sitetree item option. Instead, you may use hardcoded URLs.

* Do not use access permissions restrictions (access rights) where not required.

* Use Django templates caching machinery.

* Use fast Django cache backend.

    !!! warning
        Sitetree uses Django cache framework to store trees data, but keep in mind that
        Django's default is [Local-memory caching](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/#local-memory-caching)
        that is known not playing well with multiple processes (which will eventually cause sitetree to render navigation
        in different states for different processes), so you're advised to use the other choices.

        You can specify the cache backend to use, setting the `SITETREE_CACHE_NAME` on the django settings to specify the name 
        of the cache to use.
